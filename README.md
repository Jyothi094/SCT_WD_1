As part of the SkillCraft Technology Internship (Web Development Track), I created a responsive landing page with a fixed and interactive navigation menu.

- 🔄 **Scroll Interaction**: The navigation bar changes its background color or shadow when the user scrolls.
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works smoothly on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
